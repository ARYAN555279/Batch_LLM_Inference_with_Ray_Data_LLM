## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin, you need to set up your environment. Follow the installation instructions below to get started quickly.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- pip
- Access to a GPU (optional, but recommended for performance)

---

## 🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARYAN555279/Batch_LLM_Inference_with_Ray_Data_LLM.git
cd Batch_LLM_Inference_with_Ray_Data_LLM
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📖 Usage

To use the batch inference feature, follow these simple steps. First, load your model and prepare your data.

### Example Code

Here’s a basic example to get you started:

```python
from ray import serve

# Initialize Ray
import ray
ray.init()

# Load your LLM
@serve.deployment
def llm_inference(request):
    # Logic for LLM inference here
    pass

# Deploy the service
serve.run(llm_inference.bind())
```

---

## 📊 Examples

Explore practical examples to see how batch inference works with different LLMs. Each example demonstrates a specific feature or use case.

### Example 1: Sentiment Analysis

Use the LLM to analyze the sentiment of a batch of texts:

```python
texts = ["I love this!", "This is terrible."]
results = llm_inference(texts)
print(results)
```

### Example 2: Text Generation

Generate text based on a prompt:

```python
prompts = ["Once upon a time", "In a galaxy far away"]
generated_texts = llm_inference(prompts)
print(generated_texts)
```
